✨ Fun Little Things

I love creating UI that feels good, not just works.

I enjoy blending fitness tech with game mechanics.

Most of my ideas begin as messy sketches and end up as polished screens.

⭐ If you like my work…

You can star my projects—helps me know what to improve, expand, or turn into bigger releases.

If you want, I can also prepare:

🔥 a version with animated GitHub stats cards
🎨 a version that matches your pixel-art profile photo
🔧 a more technical version (architecture diagrams, stack badges)
